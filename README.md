CatBNB is a full-stack web application inspired by AirBNB. It utilizes Ruby on Rails on the backend, a PostgreSQL database, and React.js with a Redux architectural framework on the frontend.

## Features and Implementation

###### Rendering Listings

###### Adding Listings

###### Navigation

###### Search and Autocomplete

## Future Direction on Project

In addition to the features already implemented, I plan to continue work on this project. The next steps for HairBNB are outlined below.

###### Profiles

Profiles are a standard feature on AirBNB and inform guests about the person hosting them. I will add a profiles page that allows the user to share public information with other users they interact with, once a connection is made.

###### Host Approval

Hosts should be able to accept or decline requests from other users. I would like to create a way for hosts to validating a reservation.

###### Uploading pictures and gallery

It would be amazing to allow users to view multiple pictures of a listing, instead of just the cover image. I managed to create galleries for my other projects, and with some more time I would like to create a JavaScript gallery to display multiple pictures of the listing.

###### Fixed Reservation Box

I would also like to make the reservation box fixed, so that the box continues to appear on the screen as the viewer scrolls down the page.
